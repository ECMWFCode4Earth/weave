# Pre-processed cache data
This folder contains PECD4.2 that has already been pre-processed, to make it easy for new users to get started.

Daily means have been computed for all variables, all countries, and all existing technologies. 

NB: To gain space, the data have been compressed using a (slightly) lossy compression method (Granular Bit Rounding). If this is a problem for you, you will need to re-process the data with the full hourly dataset.
